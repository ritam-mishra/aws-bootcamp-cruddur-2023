# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework
### Containerize Application
* Created a Dockerfile within the *flask-backend* and *frontend-react-js* folders containing the image instructions.  
[Backend Dockerfile](https://github.com/ritam-mishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile "Backend Dockerfile") - [Frontend Dockerfile](https://github.com/ritam-mishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile "Frontend Dockerfile")
* I copied the *docker-compose.yml* file contents from project repo and made sure it can run all the docker containers in a single command
[docker-compose file](https://github.com/ritam-mishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml "docker-compose file")
* I added DynamoDB Local and Postgres to that *Docker-compose.yml* file, after following the steps from the youtube playlist
* Now docker compose up to run the containers (building the specific images if needed) and wait until all containers are in *started* state.

### Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
Following along with the *Create the notification feature* video:
* In the [openapi-3.0.yml file link](https://github.com/ritam-mishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/openapi-3.0.yml "openapi-3.0.yml") file, I added a new path *"/api/activities/notifications:"*, as per the guided video.

## Homework Challenges

### Push and tag a image to DockerHub
* To push the image, first I logged into my DockerHub account with `docker login`  
* Created the repository with the image name on DockerHub.
* Tagged the image with *ritammishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023-frontend-react-js:1.0* as the first version tag and pushed it.

* I repeated the above steps and pushed my backend image in the same way-
* Tagged the image with *ritammishra/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023-backend-flask:1.0* as the first version tag and pushed it.
